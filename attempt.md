# Introduction

Since its foundation in 1923, the Republic of Turkey has witnessed multiple
coups that were carried out by the staunchly secular military. With the first
coup happening in 1960, and the next ones happening in 1971, 1980, and 1997to
cite a few, it seems that a coup is expected every ten years or so. Each coup
took a characteristic form. The 1971 coup, for instance, was called a _coup
by memorandum_ or more famously as _post-modern coup_, while the coup of 2007
was dubbed _E-memorandum_ as the General Staff simply released a statement on
the Turkish Armed Forces website before the presidential elections of 2007
without directly intervening and seizing the power by force. Nevertheless,
the military coup of 1960 remains the most important event that Turkish
people till this day view under different lights.

## Background

In order to understand the reasons that led to the execution of the military
coup of 1960, it is important to consider the historical context it took place in.
Since the foundation of the Republic, Turkey has only known a single-party
system under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, only to be succeeded by
Ismet Inonu.

The Turkish economy stagnated during the 1950s. Even though Turkey was not
directly involved in the World War, the global situation put a tremendous
stress on Turkey's economy. People struggled to find food and could not
provide shelter to themselves and their families. People were discontent with
the current economic policies and wanted a new government that could take
them out of this misery.

Things changed when Turkey introduced the multiparty system in 1946. At the
time, the only party that opposed the Republican People's Party (RPP) was the
Democratic Party (DP). Although it participated in the first free elections
in 1946, it couldn't garner much support. Four years later however, the DP
was well prepared to win the elections of 1950's against the longstanding RPP
with its three decades of uninterrupted rule. 

Celal Bayar, ex-member of the RPP that was unhappy with its policies, 
presided the new DP government, with Adnan Menderes as his Prime Minister.
[^1] The newly formed government was committed to economic growth. The DP
aimed to achieve this progress mainly by reducing state interference and
allowing for more liberal economic policies. [^2] 

In the first few years, it seemed that the DP was successful at bringing
change to the economic situation. Good harvest in 1950 and 1953 helped
temporarily alleviate the problems, while the Korean War, which was the first
war fought by Turkish forces on foreign soil, caused an economic boom and
allowed Turkey, after nearly 30 years of neutrality towards international
affairs, to join the United Nations and secure its role as a strong leader in
the Middle East region.[^3] [^4] 

Unfortunately, this economic upheaval didn't last for long and problems
started to appear in 1953. Poor harvest in the next few years wasn't enough
to satisfy the demands of the population, which forced Turkey to import wheat
once again from neighboring countries. This problem was aggravated with
Turkey's lack of foreign exchange, which limited its power to purchase
essential materials. Turkey was also facing on the highest inflation rates in
its history, which averaged 15% annually drowning Turkey even more into an
economic depression. The Democratic Party tried to mitigate the effects of
the inflation by controlling the prices through legislation with no success.
Its continually rising public expenditure led to the prices soaring even
more, making the DP less and less popular in the eyes of the people. [^5]

The Democratic Party was now facing mounting criticism both from its members and
outside environment. The RPP accused DP of trying to reverse the achievements of
Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, and particularly a principle that he stressed about:
Secularism. In fact, under the DP's regime, conservative religious organization
spread further in the country, religious schools were permitted to instruct, 
Arabic was reinstated for the prayer call. [^6] 

In spite of being able to justify their ascension to power through democratic
elections, the democrats still felt insecure and perhaps inferior as long as
Ismet Inonu was the leader of the RPP. Even though they had the political power
by being a legitimate government, they were unsure about their hold over the
state institutions, which remained loyal to the founding Party in general and
Ismet Inonu in particular. To this end, the DP stressed on its dependence on the
national will to legitimize the power it holds and the actions it takes.[^7]

This insecurity surfaced in the many attempts of the DP to use military
forces to prevent Inonu from entering cities all across Turkey and address
citizens. But due to their respect for the old Chief, most soldiers did not
obey the orders and left Inonu free to travel. [^8] 

Feeling that it is losing its grip over the country, the government responded
to criticism with redoubled repression. in an attempt to weaken RPP, DP
through the National Assembly in which it is majoritary, passed a law that
would allow for the confiscation of most of the RP's property and assets on
December 9 1953. [^9] This fueled even stronger opposition attacks, which
accused the DP of unconstitutional actions. The DP, fearing reprisal and a
revolution, whirled in a spiral of increasing repression to increasing
protests and discontent. [^10]

Another important aspect to consider is the attitude DP had towards the military
institution. During this period, the cost of living soared and the military was
neglected, suffocating officers and soldiers alike to the point of humiliation.
In Ankara, cheap basement flats were called "Staff-Officer flats", and officers
"lemonaders" because they couldn't afford the more expensive drinks.[^11] People were
disappointed at the DP for not sticking to its promised programme that was
intended to improve the situation of the military. The DP did not understand the
importance of the military in Turkish society and thought it was more
prioritary to spend money on roads, cement factories and other projects to
enhance the country's development[^12]

The year 1959 was marked with increased paranoia, political instability, and
censorship. Newspapers were banned, journalists taken to prison in
unprecedented numbers. Perhaps the biggest event that sparked the coup was
the Kayseri event in April 1960. Government officials stopped the train
taking Ismet Inonu to Kayseri and asked him to return to Ankara. After
waiting for three hours, he was allowed to go. The government started to
accuse the RPP of instigating the military for a coup. Adnan Menderes himself
claimed to have documents to prove this. This provoked the military officers
and caused indignation throughout the military and academic institutions. [^13]

## Coup d'Etat

In light of the economic and political downward spiral that Turkey was caught
in, and in the attitude the DP had towards the military, discontent in the armed
forces took a political form. People like Colonel Alparslan Türkeş had a different vision
for Turkey than the ones deemed acceptable by the ruling élite. [^14] He was a
member of the junta and orchestrated the plot.

On May 26, 1960, the armed forces took control by arresting the Turkish
President Celal Bayar, his prime minister Adnan Menderes as well as a few
other leading political party officers. The following morning, on May 27
1960, the following speech was broadcasted at 7 a.m. broadcast over Ankara
Radio:

> Honorable fellow countrymen! Owing to the crisis into which our democracy
> has fallen, in view of the recent sad incidents, and in order to avert
> fratricide, the Turkish Armed Forces have taken over the administration
> of the country. Our armed forces have taken this initiative for the
> purpose of extricating the parties from the irreconcilable situation into
> which they have fallen … (and will hold) just and free elections as soon
> as possible under the supervision and arbitration of an above-party
> administration. [^15]

The military took over the power and declared Marshal Law. The coup was to
last only 18 months. At the beginning, the roadmap of the junta was not
clear. Some officers intended that the government should be chosen by free
elections after removing the corrupted politicians, another group was in
favor of passing the power back to Ismet Inonu. The highest ranking officers
were in neither group. They decided that constitutional changes needed to be
made first. [^16]

To that end, a new military committee, called National Unity Committe, was
formed and presided by Cemal Gursel. The task of the NUC was to draft a new
constitution that would limit the power of the government to prevent the same
abuse from happening again in the future. The NUC promised to return the
country to civilian life as quickly as possible. One of Atatürk's efforts and
principles was to keep the military and politics separate, which is the
reason why the military was against staying in power for too long. The
deputies and leading members of the Democratic Party were put on trial for
the violation of the constitution of 1924.

One interesting anecdote about this military coup was the fact that it was initiated
not by the top echelon of the military like most coup d'etats in the
world but by the _lower rank_ of officers. In fact most of the officers were under
the age of 40 years old.

## A new constitution
Immediately after the coup, the NUC started working on the new constitution.
They appointed a committee of five law professors to create the first draft. The
constitution took its final form in May and was approved by 61 percent of the
voters at referendum in July [^17]

The new constitution introduced a bicameral system through a two-chamber
parliament made up of the Republican Senate and the Turkish Grand National
Assembly. Because the DP was able to pass almost any law through the National
Assembly as it held the vast majority (90%) of the seats, the Senate would
act as a dampener that would limit their control and have stricter
supervision over the drafted acts. Another two institutions were the
Constitutional court and the State Planning Organization. The first
institutions' job was to supervise the actions of the government and be on
the watch for any abuse that is unconstitutional and threatens the foundation
of Republic of Turkey. The latter was introduced in order to bring about a
systematic approach to investments and a solid long-term economic planning
that can withstand political instability better. [^18]

Another interesting point about the new constitution is that it focused on
protecting social rights and freedoms of citizens. It put individual rights and
liberties at the heart by not only enumerating basic rights but describing
their components in details [^22]

## Purge and Yassıada Trials
Two months after the coup, the Democratic Party was abolished. Many leading
political members were brought to trial for charges of unconstitutional rule
and corruption. They were taken to a small island in the Bosphorus called
Yassıada. The trials lasted almost a year. Out of 601 tried Democrats, 464
were found guilty. [^19] Three former ministers, Fatin Rüştü Zorlu, Hasan
Polatkan, and prime minister Adnan Menderes, were sentenced to death for high
treason. They were taken to İmralı Island, further southwest of İmralı, near
the southern shoreline of Marmara sea, to be executed in 1961. [^20]

The actions taken by the NUC did not stop at the Democratic Party and its
members. A country-wide purge was launched, which resulted in over 5000
officers dismissed or retired, including 235 of the 260 generals, 147
university teachers dismissed, and 55 wealthy landowners banished from Turkey,
with their lands confiscated.[^21]

After the 1960 coup "Yassıada" name was remembered negatively, which led the
island to be renamed as "Democracy and Freedom Island" on November 7, 2013 [^20]

## Back to civilian life
After the constitution was drafted, the referendum of July 9, 1961 took place
for the first time in Turkish Republic history. Out of 10,322,169 votes,
6,348,191 (61.7%) of them accepted the new constitution. [^23] While the number is
above 50% percent, it leaves to wonder why 40% voted against it. This percentage
can be interpreted as lukewarm support. People were skeptic of the new
constitution and the military regime behind it. They feared a return to the
single-party system due to the Republic Party's majority in the House of
Representatives when the constitution was prepared. [^24]

Once the new constitution was ratified, the army, as promised, withdrew from
direct political involvement. The NUC however retained some influence through its
members in the Republican Senate. [^25]

# Criticism
The 1960's coup d'état is not without opposing views. Some people view the 1960
as a necessity that was carried out by the military in order to prevent the
Islamization efforts of the country by Celal Bayar and his prime minister Adnan
Menderes and protect the Kemalist principle of secularism, while others believe
there is more to it than what is told. 

One particular theory for why the coup d'etat happened has to do with the
situation of the Western world, specifically of the invisible struggle of
power that was happening between the Western capitalist block, namely the United States,
and the Eastern communist bloc, namely the former Soviet Union. 

The conservative approach of the DP party seemed to have been encouraged by the
United States. The probably reasoning for this was the fact that Islam could be
an effective weapon to contain the spread of communism in the region, given that
Islam's principles conflict with many of the communist ideas. In that regards,
the US was either passively or actively encouraging the practices of DP.

The Soviet Union had for a long time and on multiple instances attempted to
seize control of the Straits. It considers the strait of utmost importance as
it connects the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, and would allow for
strategic military and trade opportunities. During the 1940s, after the World
War II, Turkey was pressured to allow the free flow of Russian ships through
the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits. Territorial integrity and sovereignty
was crucial for Turkey, therefore it did not submit. This led to tense
relations in the region, where the Soviet would threaten Turkey with military
intervention by making a show of naval force. Since the British assistance
ended in 1947, some other power had to intervene to help contain the Soviet
threat. At the same time, an American foreign policy called the Truman
Doctrine was announced on March 12, 1947, whose goal is to contain the
geopolitical expansion of the Soviets during the Cold War. It became clear to
the United States how strategically important Turkey was in this mission. To
this end, the U.S. sent a $100 million economic and military aid package that
would empower Turkey to remain in chief control of the straits.[^26]

Although the economy seemed to be coming back on track during the beginning of
the DP's term, the poor harvest combined with diminishing aid from the US pushed
the DP to look for other ways to patch up the deficit. It seems that the
Democratic Party was considering to ask the Soviet Union for credit. This credit
wouldn't of course be given without a list of requirements from the Soviet
Union and the US wouldn't be happy about Soviet Union expanding their sphere of
influence to Turkey and neighboring countries.

Despite US's encouragement of the DP in the first phase, seeing as how DP is
now turning to the soviets for help, it decided that DP was becoming a threat
and needed to be dealt with in some way or another. In fact, it was no
surprise that Colonel Alparslan Türkeş would be the one orchestrating the
coup plot. He was member of the junta and had been among the first 16
officers trained by the US in 1948 to form a stay-behind counter-guerilla,
codenamed Operation Gladio, whose existence in Turkey was revealed in 1973 by
survivors of the Ziverbey incident in 1971 and officially on 26 September
1973 by the then-prime minister Bulent Ecevit. [^27]

The sole fact that Alparslan had this connection with the United States gives this
coup d'état a whole new dimension.

The constitution is also not without criticism. Many points introduced that
seemed to be good at the time caused a few headaches down the road. Among the
critiques was the fact that the fundamental rights and freedoms, as they were
stated in the new constitution, could be improperly exploited. The bicameral
structure of the Parliament complicated the method of enactment and slowed
down the introduction of new legislations or executives actions, sometimes to
the point of making governing and taking urgent decisions impossible, as was
the case during the violent civil unrest between the left and right wings in
Turkey during the 1970s. Another point was that universities considered
themselves totally independent from the state as was arranged for by the new
constitution, giving them breeding ground for propaganda in the years to come.
These critiques brought about new amendments in the Constitutions for a total of
seven amendments between 1969 and 1974.

# Conclusion
The 1960's coup is an event in the modern history of the Republic Turkey that
won't be forgotten any time soon. It lies at the transition from 30 years of
single-party rule to a multi-party system that Turkey experiences for the first
time. It asserts the military's influential role in the path followed by Turkey
and the ways it protects the Kemalist principles of both Republicanism and
Secularism. It also insists on the crucial role that Turkey plays as geopolitical
power in the Middle East region as it tries to reconcile the Western and
Eastern's conflicting interests and guarantees its territorial integrity.
