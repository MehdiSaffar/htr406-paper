## Transition from one party to multiparty system

1. **1919-1922**: National Struggle

1. **1923 July 24**

    Lausanne Peace Treaty was signed between Ankara govt.and the European
    powers. Europe recognized Turkey as an _independent and sovereign power_. In
    these negotiations, the Eastern Question was on the agenda. They believed that
    by the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, they had solved this
    problem completely.

1. **1923 Oct 29:** Turkish Republic was declared

1. **1923:** RPP/CHP (Republican People's Party/Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi) was set up by Atatürk  

    All the revolutionary steps were carried out by this party. The founding principles of the Republic were determined and put into practice through this party.

1. **1923 - 1926**: Turkey was ruled under a single-party system.

    RPP did not like the monopoly that it had. Atatürk always wanted to establish a multiparty system. He tried twice to setup another party.

1. **1924**: First multiparty system effort

    They decided to create an opposition/alternative political party. This
    party is called PRP/TCP (Progressive Republican Party/Terakkiperver
    Cumhuriyet Partisi).

    Every one who opposed to the regime or Atatürk personally, ideologically/religiously/economically came and joined this opposition party.

    There are interesting names of people who joined this party:

     - **Hüseyin Cahit Yalçın**: This guy has been writing on the national papers since
     Meşrutiyet (Second Constitutional Period) 1908. He was for changing the
     alphabet and everything but was personally opposed to Atatürk. He also
     thought that women should be allowed to vote in the elections.
     Ideologically they are not different but he opposes him personally.

     - Some people did not like the constitution. They wanted the
     Sharia to be the law.

     - Those who are against RPP for economic reasons also joined PRP.
     For example the Ağa people that used to own the lands during the Ottoman
     Empire. They were against RPP policies, because the state wanted to
     distribute it back to the villagers who don't have any land.

    This was the Democratic, Legal and Real/Natural opposition party

    Shortly after it was established, something unexpected happened in the Eastern region. It has to do with the Islamic riots carried out by Sheikh Sait.

1. **1925-1926**: Sheikh Sait Rebellion.

    Organized a kind of a riot against the regime and the republic. He
    happened to be Kurdish but this is not a type of ethnic rising. The guy
    was carrying a green flag and banners which had "la illaha illa allah"
    written on it. They wanted a more conservative approach. Wanted a revival
    of the old Ottoman structure. A lot of people supported this guy. They
    were marching in the streets from one city to another. There was a big
    rebellion against the state structure.
    
    Interestingly enough, the timing was perfect. At the exact same time,
    turks were trying to take Mossul back by preparing a military operation.
    The military forces who wanted to cross borders and wanted to crry out
    the military operation had to come back to deal with the rebellion.
    
    => Could not carry out this operation
    
    In a year of time, The Leage of Nations decided Mossul should be given to
    Iraq (which is a British mandate).
    
    All the captured weapons in Sheikh Sait Rebellion were British-made
    weapons.
    
    The opposition party supported the rebellion. They were put into trials
    and were found guilty. The party was banned because of the anti-secular
    policies, the threat it was posing to the Turkey.

    To fight this rebellion, TGND passed the Law on the Maintenance of Order
    in March 1925. This law gave the govt. the right to ban any organization
    or publication that it considered to be a cause of disturbance to law and
    order.
    
    Indepence Tribunals were setup and the party was closed down.

1. **1930**: Second multiparty system effort

    #### Why 1930?
    Great Depression. Effected the whole world as well as Turkey.
    
    The Turkish nationalists all of a sudden realized that up until then
    they had focused on the political side of these reforms, but nothing
    economically. All of a sudden they were caught with this big crisis and
    they didn't know how to deal with this crisis. They were looking for
    advice on how to deal with this crisis. They needed an opposing party
    which would come up with alternative solutions to this problem.

    For the first time, the letters exchanged between Atatürk and his very close friend (Ali Fetih Okyar, who did not oppose him) were published in a newspaper for everbody to read. The letters showed that Atatürk wanted an opposition party to exist. It was kind of artificial.

    Ali Fetih Okyar founded SCF/FRP (Serbest Cumhuriyet Furkası/Free Republican Party) in 1930 to deal with the economic problems of the time and to come up with healthy criticism.

    There were two things that Atatürk was very sensitive about, for which there would be no discussion:

    - Secularism
    - Republicanism

    These should not be challenged.

    The party was in favor of: 

    - more liberal economic policies 
    - more open political system

    The party did not really do well in the local elections. In
    order to increase the popularity of this party, he encouraged them to
    join the party (literally going to them telling them please leave my
    party and join that party). He encouraged and he even put his sister's
    name to this party to show that he was supporting this free opposition
    party. Exactly the same thing happened with the previous opposition
    party. All the elements who were against Atatürk and his regime joined
    this party. Ataturk's regime decided to close the party because it posed
    a threat to the republic.
    
    Only 13 people joined the FRP. Why were they hesitant? They had a
    bad a feeling from the first experience.

1. **1946**: Third multiparty system effort 

    Enrollment of the Democratic Party.

    ### Why did Turkey choose to adopt this multiparty system?

    #### Internal reasons

    1. **Growing criticism within RPP**: 

        Most of the criticism concentrated on the stateist policies of the RPP. 

        - State doesn't give a space to the private sector.
        - More liberal policies should be adopted.
        - Private sector should be supported.
        - New (bourgeois) class was born and was demanding more liberal policies

    1. **Negative consequences from the WWII**:

        - High inflation, shortages of food, black marketeering, people were stocking rice...
        - Could not afford food, people...
        - The state did not want to borrow money for outside powers => people were poor already and had to pay extra taxes.
        - RPP's very strict observance of secularism policies upsetted people.

    1. **RPP's land policies**:

        RPP's land policy was to redistribute the land for those who don't have lands. Obviously, the land owners would be unhappy about this. Adnan Menderes was a big owner and was against this land reform.

    #### External reasons

    1. **Turkey wanted to side with the WWII winners (capitalism)**: 

        And all those had a multiparty system. So they wanted to adopt their system and join the capitalist world.
    

    2. **1945: WWII ended and Turkey rushed to Russians**:

        The treaty that we signed expired, should we renew it?
        The response was "I am not sure. Perhaps we should go through the rules and regulations of this treaty because we have new demands".

        - We should defend the staits together = we should have military presence/base there.
        - We are considering some territorial changes in The Eastern borders of Turkey = they are asking for land (like Artwin)
        - We would like to seize some modifications in the Montreux Convention in our favor (of Russia) (defines the regime of the Straits)

        Turkey saw Russia as a threat, and they turned to the Western block.

    3. **You need to follow the money**:

        The USA said "We are going to help financially, military to anyone who suffered in the WWII".

        This aid program is known as Marshall Plan.

        The USA is trying to help the Europeans but gain allies also. On top
        of it, the USA gave financial help to Turkey (100 million dollars) as
        well as Greece (300 million dollars). The reason is that communists
        were about to takeover Greece and USA wanted to get rid of them.

# Lecture 3, 25-18-2020

After the signature of the Lausanne Treaty in 1923, Turkey wanted to
establish friendly relationships with the Western countries and cooperate
with Western powers without breaking its links with Moscow. It was also
crucial to Turkey.

Turkey saw membership of the League of Nations as a necessary step to restore
its relations with the Western powers.

League of Nations (equivalent to United Nations) was founded by (?) right
after WW1 in order to provide a secure environment for the nations who were
involved in it. It would serve to preserve peace.

When they accepted an invitation to join the League of Nations in 1932, 
Turkey was quite careful to obtain the approval of the USSR. This position
was naturally eased when the USSR joined the League.

When they joined, two powers left the league. These powers were called
Revisionist powers, who wanted to overthrow the status-quo because they
couldn't get what they wanted. In order to make these changes they wanted to
leave the League. These powers were

* Germany left in 1933
* Japan left in 1933
* Italy left in 1935

As Europe moved towards war in the 30s, the main focus of Turkey's security concern lay in the balkans. Balkans, as the Ottomans described, is the "traditional zone of danger" for the Ottoman empire.

### Why did they see it as a potential threat to Ottoman's territorial integrity?

* Serbia, Greece, Montenegro, Bulgaria formed the Balkan League in 1912-13 and sort of revolted against the Ottoman rule.

With the removal of the threat of Russia (because of the Russian revolution etc... ), they was another country in the Mediterranean emerging as a threat to Turkey's security and territorial integrity: 

=> Italy was the major power/state that emerged as a most powerful potential enemy for the Turks, followed later by Germany.

* In 1928, Turkey signed a treaty of Neutrality. Still Turkey couldn't trust those countries whose leaders (Mussolini in Italy, Hitler in Germnay)' speeches were quite ... 

* Turkey signed a treaty with Greece in 1930, trying to build a block to prevent Germany and Italy from invading her.

* Turkey signed seperate non-aggression pact with Romania and Yugoslavia in Feb-March 1934, as it is trying to make a friendly "circle" around in order to keep its security intact.

* During the late 1930's however, this pact became weaker and weaker as time went by because Yugoslavia and Romania drifted into the German orbit.

* In July 27 1937, Turkey extended its regional security pacts eastward when Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan concluded another pact called the SADABAD pact in order to  

    - preserve their common frontiers 
    - not to intervene into one another's territory
    - to consult together on all matters of common interests.

---

Security was the essential issue of the Turks, because some powers (such as Italy and Germany) were trying to change the international system.

To achieve greater security, Turkey had to achieve 3 objectives:

1. __Strengthen its military positions in the Thrace and Dardanelles__ Expecting attacks from German and Italy there
1. __Build up and modernize its armed forces__ expecting attacks from German and Italy there
1. __Reach a defensive alliance with Britain and France__ while preserving its position with Moscow

    *Why was it willing to do with BR and FR?*
    In order to counter-balance the threat from Germany and Italy and because BR and FR were the ones who wanted to keep the status-quo.

---

Turkish foreign policy in 1923-1945 has been described as `cautious, realistic and generally aimed at preserving the status-quo` 

Turkey, in fact, wanted to stay away from any kind of international conflict, by maintaining a policy of neutrality.

Best way of describing its foreign policy is `active neutrality` .
Ankara devoted considerable energy in order to stay out of the war as it felt that the country was not ready on any level to be involved in another major war.

Turkey's wartime strategy consisted of:

* maintaining cordial relations but _distant_ relations with the fighting parties.

#### Is it correct to say that Turkey was _impartial_ during the war?

* In order to join the UN, you had to have to declare the war on Germany before some deadline. Turkey declared the war in 23rd of February, close to the deadline. By that time it was obvious that Germany was the defeated power.
* Impartial is not the right term, because Turkey sided with BR and FR. Not only sided but signed a treaty of mutual support with them in Oct 1939 (Ankara Accord).
* When they signed this, Turkey insisted on an attachment of a separate protocol. That seperate protocol stipulated that Turkey was not obligated to get into any kind of agreement that would put her in a war with the USSR. Turkey did not want to upset the USSR basically.

Turkish govt.accepted to carry out its commitment and join the war on the side of the allies (side of BR and FR) only if the war was expanded into the mediterranean (which it did expand when Italy entered the war).

BR and FR promised to deliver arms, guns, ammunition to Turkey (because Turkey doesn't have any arms to fight).

When Italy entered the war on June 10th 1940, this created a situation which would oblige Turkey to side with the allies.

#### What was Turkey's excuse not to join the war?

France surrended within a month. The France govt declared Armistice.
Turkey argued that France was now dropping out of the war, which relieved Turkey from their obligations.

> TR: Look, your main ally is dropping out of the war. How can you force us to join the war?   
> TR: You promised to deliver us arms. It is your turn to deliver those guns to us.  
> BR: But unfortunately we will not be able to give the amount we promised you, because they were going to collect arms from France as well. Britain was alone and could not keep its promise.  
> TR: You keep saying we don't have enough arms. Suppose that we took this limited amt. Everybody knows that without sufficient military equipment. When we lose the war, what would happen "ey britain!"? Where would Germany go?   
> TR: If we are defeated, Germany would invade Middle East which was a crucial area for BR interests   

---

In 1939, something unexpected happened: A Nazi Soviet Pact came as a shock to Turkish policy makers.

Hitler and Ribbentorp met at Berlin. Soviets made it clear that they regarded control of the straits as essential to their security.

> RU: We want to control the straits, and you stay out of it.  
> GER: Okay, but tell the Turks to leave the Allies.

In 1941, German advances in the Balkans. Obviously, Turkey was concerned about this.
Germany invaded Balkans and Italy invaded Greece.

Hitler's army was within seconds of invading Thrace. It came to a shock that
Hitler came with non-agression pact with Turkey, which was signed in June
18th 1941 with a validity of 10 years. Hitler actually wanted to hit Russia.
His plan was to hit Russia then come back to Turkey (heh).

German troops moved North towards Russia in June 22nd 1941. The tide turned
when the Germans surrendered at Stalingrad and the US entered into the war, 
following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in December 1941.

### Why did German fail on the Russian frontier?

* Russians were better used to and equipped for the cold weather
* Germans were very divided by the distance between Stalingrad and Moscow. Communication was difficult
* They still had to fight on North Africa and couldn't concentrace on that front.
* Fatigue (sometimes not sleeping for 3 days straight, and at some point they had to use drugs)
* Mismanagement might have contributed (better at macro, worse at micro)
* Germans had very powerful tanks which they couldn't use because of the cold weather (since the fuel froze inside it)

# Lecture 3, 03-03-2020

Severalconferences were held to put pressure on Turkey:

* Adana 
* Moscow (Oct-Nov 1943)
* Tehran (Nov-Dec 1943)
* Kahire, Egypt (Oct)
* Moscow (1944)

In all of these conferences, Ismet Inonu (Prime Minister at that time) stressed:

* Turkey's miltary inadequacy
* Shortfall in supplies from the British

During Spring and Summer 1944, the Allies put pressure on Turkey to break diplomatic but also commercial relations with Germany

__Why ?__ Chrome  
__Why is Chrome important?__ Used for arms, ammunition... 

On August 1944, Turkey broke off diplomatic relations with Germany. This decision was taken in Alta conference ... restricted to those states which had joined the war on the side of Allies ... 

> Declare war on Germany before March 1, 1945 you have the right to be invited as a founding member of the United Nations

Turkey declared war in Feb 23, 1945, a week before the deadline. By that time Germany was a defeated power anyway.

Turks wanted to make sure that their relations with the Soviets was stable. Turkey took a new step to negotiate with the soviets a renewal of the treaty of friendship.

**Why negotiate with the soviets?** Because the treaty between them and the USSR in 1925 was just about to expire in 1945.

The Soviet's proposal was:

* The future of the Straits should be discussed through bilateral-level. In other words, Stalin wanted to detach Turkey from the Allies' support
* Territorial changes in favor of the Soviets in the eastern part of Turkey.(Kars, Ardahan, Artvin)
* Some changes in the Montreux Straits Convention which will put them in a more advantageous position.

By careful diplomacy, Inonu saved the country from the horrors of war.
Without doubt, Turkey's most important national interest was to avoid the
destruction of war _without sacrificing independence_ of any of the territory
it had won in 1923. To achieve this, Ismet Inonu and his colleagues, they
successfully exploted Turkey's strategic position. He adopted the classical
method of **playing one power against the other**.

All in all Turkish diplomacy was successful in keeping Turkey out of harm. However, the war had profound effect on Turkey's domestic, political and economic situation.

* International trade fell
* Cost of living index rose to over 3x by 1943
* Some people made great money out of this, like black marketeers for example. On other hand, those on fixed income suffered. 
* These price rises caused great discontent among people. People could not find food, even basic food like bread.

In summer 1945, four deputies in the RPP to the GNA 
 - __Celal Bayar__: (most important)  

    Has been in Turkish politics since the Ottoman time. He worked in  Young Turk institution. He was the PM of Ataturk right before Atatuk died. When Ataturk became President of Turkey in 1923, Inonu was the prime minister. But in the last year, it was Celal. 

 - __Adnan Menderes__:

    Very wealthy landowner in Aydin. He went to Law School but he probably didn't graduate. He was very against RPP's land distribution reform.

 - __Rafik Koraltan__: Been in Politics since RPP. Very active.
 - __Fuat Koprulu__: History professor.

 These four were not happy with RPP's reform. _Reform_ and _democracy_ were the
 key words. Upon taking their case to their press, they were expelled from
 the RPP.

 In January 1946, the Democratic Party was founded by these four. DP recognized the widespread desire  

 - for more open Islamic observances (that's why they got the support of people.)
 - for relaxation of some secular requirements

 They put these right at the center of their policies. For the first time, political islam rose in Turkish politics.

 ## Democratic Party (DP)

 - After the WWII, Turkey showed that it wanted to be part of the Western world and their institutions.
 - After the WWII, we observed more liberal political, economic and social attitudes in the country.
 - It was no longer possible to satisfy people within the confines of a single party.
 - Once peace was achieved, the RPP party was split
 - For the first time, Turkey experiences multiparty system in 1946.
 - After the war, came the swift and sudden change which ended one-party rule.
 - Turkey set the parliement on a road to parliamentary democracy.
 - After 27 years of uninterrupted rule by the RPP government, now we have another party.

First free elections in 1946:
 - RPP(?) manipulated the elections with open vote closed counting. They did not want to lose the power. Had they not intervened, the DP wouldn't have won anyway because they were too young and people didn't know who they are or what their programs were.
 - RPP won

 In 1950's elections, the democrats were now well prepared. The first time a free and peaceful election were held in the country.  
 ==> Defeat of RPP and replacement of power.

 In fact, RPP was well aware of the trend of opinion in Turkey after 1945, that things were changing in Turkey. There were many indication of pro-Western/pro-Democratic trends that were running much deeper in the country. 
 
 Many different factors contributed to this growth of this trend:

 1. Merchants, landowners and new emerging bourgeois class was not happy with the stateist policies. They wanted free enterprise. Stateist policies did not bring any solutions in the eyes of the Liberals.
 1. US inherited the place of Germany as a main bulwark in resistance to Russian threat
 1. Again, there was this new generation in Turkey to whom nationalism alone was no longer enough. Because they were brought up in an intensive Westernization, they were deeply attracted by the Western liberal traditions.
 1. Saw it an opportunity of integration of Turkey into the free Western world on the basis of equality and mutual respect.

There were also practical reasons for change:

1. The strains of war has given rise to a really serious discontent among the people. People were poor, they couldn't provide shelter, they couldn't buy food...

All these reasons contributed to the victory of DP in the 1950's elections. Democrats had appealed to those seeking a change of regime.

__What percentage in the parliament during the elections?__ 90%  
__What percentage in the parliament in 1954?__ 94%

After the victory, Inonu stepped down as an opposition leader. Celal Bayar became the third President of Turkey after Ismet Inonu. Adnan Menderes was the Prime Minister.

Between 1950 to 1960: DP in power. They had to leave the power in 1960 because of the military coup.

**Who were the people who voted?**  

* The magnates (the heads of industry, factories...)
* The countrymen who lived in Anatolia who still wanted to practice Islam
* The landowners
* The new commercial/bourgeoisie class
* Religious people

# Lecture 3, 10-03-2020

## Democratic Party period 1950-1960

* More open to Islamic observation
* People were seeking a change
* Appealed to broad spectrum of discontent in the society, and the democrats appealed to those feeling. 

=> In 1950 elections, they had a landslide victory 

* In the Turkish Grand National Assembly 90% of the deputies were in favor the DP
* They won 396 seats in the parliament, and the RPP only 68.

After the elections, Ismet Inonu (who was the leader of the RPP) stepped down and Adnan Menderes became the prime minister and Celal Bayar became the Turkish president.

**Who were the people who voted?**  (copied)

* The magnates (the heads of industry, factories...)
* The countrymen who lived in Anatolia who still wanted to practice Islam
* The landowners
* The new commercial/bourgeoisie class
* Religious people

**The first thing DP did?**  
Because DP distrusted RPP:

* Change the top echelon of the military (They were scared of a military coup). They felt more at ease after purging the military leaders.
* The prayer call in Arabic was made legal again
* Religious education was expanded
* Number of preacher schools (imam hatip okullari) enlarged

**Why did General Kenan Evren follow the (Islamist/Conservatist?) policy?**

Everywhere he went, he started with Bismillah, he used to read passage from the Quran...
He was told that to fight communism he must spread Islam (something like that)

There is marked increase in building __mosques__ and in the __sale of religous books/literature__ everywhere.

The educated elite (civil servants, university lecturers, lawyers, officers, academics, teachers) were not happy with these changes because they represented the positivist Western-oriented outlook. In a way, these policies threatened their _cultural hegemony_ and their __monopoly of power__ for years. That's why they felt threatened with DP's right-wing policies, - or more islamic policies. The army considered themselves as the "keepers of Ataturk's heritage". In their eyes, DP was betraying these Kemalist principles. 

__Unfortunately this proved fatal for the govt.__

No basic difference between the RPP and the DP policies. Their policy was

* Friendship with US and EU
* Coolness towards Russia and the communist block
* Troops to Korea in 1950. The US wanted to help the South Koreans, but (?)... in order to be admitted in NATO, they had to show how efficient/great/fearless the turkish soldiers were when fighting in Korea. After that decision, Turkey was admitted into NATO in 1952 along with Greece.

DP also negotiated defensive military alliances with the neighboring countries. The most important ones were: 

* Turkish-Greek-Yugoslav alliance in 1954. (Did not last long, Yugoslav left)
* Turkish-Pakistani treaty (Northern Tier system of defence against Soviet Union)
* The Baghdad Pact in 1955 (Alliance with Iraq). They were hoping to bring the Arab countries together against Soviet communism, but some of them were pro-Russia (like Syria and Egypt) but they couldn't. Britain, Pakistan and Iran joined in the pact. This created even more tension among the Arab states in the Middle East. It turned into a kind of cultural (?) called CENTO

## Fundamental aspects of Turish Foreign Policy

There treaties exhibited __three fundamental aspects__ of Turkish Foreign Policy:

1. Preserve the status-quo and remain at peace
1. Recognize that Russia represented a great threat to Turkish security (and this idea was fostered by Western power and the US constantly)
1. Cultivate good relations with neighbors whenever policies

## Economic policy of the Democratic Party

Economic questions were:

* even more troublesome than the political ones.
* genuinely different from RPP's
    - RPP favored stateism/etatism whereas DP stood for relaxation of govt control.
    - More opportunity for private sector
    - Greater concentration on agricultural development

In the first half of the DP's decade 1950-1954, Turkish economy _seemed_ to
develop rapidly. There was an __apparent prosperity__ aided by the __good
weather__ (weather was on the side of the democrats lol) and __bumper grain
crops__. (a bumper crop is a crop that has yielded an unusually productive
harvest.)

The govt paid more the peasants. **Where did they get that money?**

1. US economic aid to Turkey. They gave loans and financial help. The US was helping Turkey because they wanted to keep the communists at bay.
2. Gold reserves + foreign currency of Turkey which had been saved by RPP during the war years (as emergency fund) 
3. They confiscated RPP's belongings/assets (could be a land, money, a vakif, a building), any kind of revenue...

Due to this, they won by a landslide again in the next elections

Much of these developments were

1. costly
2. uncoordinated in plan
3. in some cases, uneconomic.

# Lecture 4 (Zoom), April 7th, 2020

* Because of the political repression, because of the increase in religiosity in society, which gave their full support.. there was this fear, among some political and military circles, that they were against Ataturk's principles.

* There were these spontaneous untied government protests. Who were behind these protests? They were marching and protesting DP's practices.
    - The military students
    - The students who were at the universities
    - Student unions (leftist ones)
    - Worker unions 

* There was this growing unrest

* They were carrying signs like "ordu millet el ele"/"Military and people hand in hand".

* Before the dawn of 27 of May, armed forces took control by arresting the leading officers of DP namely Celal Bayar (President of Turkey), Adnan Menderes (Prime Minister of Turkey) and other leading political party officers.

* The power now resides within the General (General Cemal Gürsel) who initiated the coup, who became the head of state, chief of govt. and chief of general staff (so became everything really). Interestingly enough, this coup was initiated by **the lower rank** of officers, not the generals. Most of them were under 40 years old. 36 of those

* All party activity had been stopped, DP was dissolved. The deputies were arrested.

* The power was now in the hands of the National Unity Committee, and it soon became apparent that the power was now in the hands of those who favored a return to parliamentary (they didnt want to stay in power for long).

* They put the deputies and leading members of DP on trial for Violation of constitution of 1924.

* When the NUC came to power, they drafted a new constitution (of 1961). This came to the referandum on July 9th 1961. This constitution was admitted by 60.4% of the population and was quite different from the previous ones, in the sense that it was **more liberal**. It tolerated a wider spectrum of political activity both to the left and to the right. It set up another chamber (there was only one called TGNA) called Republican Senate (Cumhurityet Senatosu). Why? The deputies in TGNA from DP were majoritary so they passed whatever they wanted. Senate is there to limit their control.

* Constitutional Court is another institution added by the constituttion, also to control the laws passed by the leaading party. This insitution controls whether the new legislations were in line with the contitution.

* Economic Planning Organization (Devlet Planlama Teşkilatı) is another institution that was introduced by the new constituion. It regulates and makes plans for the economy. Political leaders could not do whatever they wanted with the economy. It restored some taxation on agricultural incomes, and on foreign credit (?)

* The constitutioin contains a strong section on individual rights. This constitution again confirmed the essential secularizing reforms of the Ataturk period.

* The trial last almost a year in (Yassi Ada, island in Marmara sea). It was a special court. Unfortunately, most of them were sentenced to death, and 3 of them (Adnan Menderes, Minister of Finance and some other guy) were hung. How just is that is still debated in Turkish political scene.

* Things were going back to normal by 1961. The ballotin(?) October 1961 gave no party a majority. 

* There was a new party setup called (Adalet Partisi, Justice Party), JP was the one that followed the DP and who claimed it inherited the DP's policies. Suleyman Demirel was the very very popular politican but didnt found JP. The founder was Gümüspala.

# 1960s in general, for Turkey and the whole world

* Years of rapid change everywhere
* People became more mobile both physically and socially.
* There was this growing student population. They were more prominent/visible.
* There was this growing industrial proleteria.
* This growth of a new left consisting of students, intellectuals, workers, unions was everywhere.
* Students and teachers began to see themselves as the moving force of the society. This was an idea that was suitable with the Kemalist ideals/concepts of revolution.
* From 1960's onwards, the youth movement was influenced by that of Germany, the US and especially from France. These peaceful movements/gatherings, later on, turned into a violent demonstration in Turkey. The violence of the left was surpassed by the violence of the militant right. This was the situation in Turkey prior to March 12th 1971 (Muhtura)
* Between 1961 to 1965, there was this coalition govt. under the leadership of RPP (It came number 1 in the elections). (PM was Ismet Inonu). 1965 was the year in which JP came to power. The founder of JP (Gumuspala) died in 1964 and was replaced by Suleyman Demirel.
* In 1971, there was military warning/memorandum (Muhtura)
* Demirel's govt. was powerless to curb the violence/protests on the campuses and on the street. He was unable to get

any kind of legislation which would put an end to this. He was also unable to get any kind of legislation on social and financial reforms to get over these difficults. Yes he was the leader of governing party, but was unable to take the necessary measures because the 1961 constitutions gave the right to protest etc so his hand were like tied. On March 12th 1971, the Chief of General Staff handed the PM a memorandum (muhtura).

# Lecture 5 (Zoom), April 14th, 2020

On March 12th 1971, the Chief of General Staff handed the PM a memorandum (muhtura). It was kind of a political warning to the govt. It was like an ultimatum. They first mentioned the situation the country was in (the negative things that Turkey w a in), and the measures that needed to be taken acording to the military

They demanded a strong and credible govt. be formed which would be able to end the political anarchy in the country, and also bring stabilty to the country's economy. They were asking for a govt to carry out the economic/financial reforms that the country should take. 

The memorandum stated that if these demands were not met, the army would exercises its constitutional duty and take over the power itself. Many on the left, first greeted this ultmatitum. They believed it was against the right-wing govt. They interpreted it as a "1960 type of coup". Unfortunately this wasn't the case. Soon they understood that this was a dreadful mistake. This time it was from the top echelon of the military, not by a group radical young officers as in the case of '60 coup. The high command, by this time, was mesmerized by the spectre of a communist threat. They see the left as the communist and a big threat that needed to be dealt with. The left was talking about the revolution, the change of the system from top to bottom, and was seeking a change in the status-quo. This was seen as a threat.

These reasons are still disputed today in Turkish politics.

**Why did this happen?** A few suggestions  

1. Senior commanders believed that Demirel (center-right) had lost his grips on power and was unable to deal with rising public disorder. There was this "political terrorism" going on and they wish to return law and order to Turkey.
2. Many officers seem to have been unwilling to bear responsbility for the govt's violent measures such as the suppression of the workers' demonstrations.
3. A minority of senior officers concluded that progress within a limited democratic system was impossible and the authoritarianism would result in a more egalitarian independent and modern Turkey. Other officers felt that they had to intervene if only to force(?) all these radical elements.

In practice it meant repression of any group which was considered as leftist. The principal motive behind this seems to be curb trade unions' militancy in order to stop the violence and mass demonstrations in the streets.

* They were not happy with the regime
* They were not happy with the low wages

They appointed an MP from RPP.

**Why would the right-wing choose someone who is considered to be on the left?**  
He had a very solid opinion in favor of the right wing. nihat erim

It was this govt, neither a normal elected govt (because there were no elections obviously, 2 years interim govt 71-73) nor an outright military dictatorship. It was something in between.

**What did this govt do?**  
As soon as they came to power, the cabinet was formed. Marshal law was declared.

**Why declare Marshal law in the country? What kind of powers would it give to the govt?**:  
Marshal law gives all power in the hands of the govt. No constitution limits the power of this govt. They are the one and only power in the country. You cannot for example marsh in the streets and protest and be critical about the policy of the govt etc.

All youth organizations were banned (almost like a crime). Hundred of students, academics, writers, trade unionists were detained. Over the next two years, this regime continued.

* In 1973, things went back to normal, and the elections were held. "Unfortunately", none of the parties were able to setup a govt on its own. Between 1973 and 1980 coup (September 12th 1980), Turkey experienced coalition govts (not a single party was in power), and were, without a doubt, weak in every sense because Turkey continued experiencing this increasing political violence and economic crisis.

* In Greece, there was a military junta/govt and it decided to get rid of Makarios to change the whole political system in Cyprus.

**Why did they want get rid of Makarios?**
He moved away from this idea of Inosis. He supported independence of Cyprus.
Inosis: Uniting Cyprus with Greece.

In 1960, the consensus was reached in Cyprus and there was a govt, there was this state "Republic of Cyprus". And the head of this republic Makarios (Greek cypriot, Arch-bishop).

## Difficult times for Turkey

* Oil crisis
* Cyrus issue.
* Turkey was producing opium and US was not happy about that. 

    ==> **Number 1 reason** why the US imposed economic sanctions on Turkey.

The left (communism) was on the rise and the US was not happy about that.

On top of these economic problems, something drastic happened which made things even worse for Turkey, economically: Oil crisis. 

OPEC (Oil Producing countries) countries decided to raise the price of oil barrels (4x), and reduced the production. The effects were detrimental on Turkey (the whole world too ofc).

### Main two issues which the country was facing up until '80s::

1. Political system gradually became paralyzed because of the two main blocks which were unable to come to terms, to cooperate, to make a consensus, to agree on something. This became apparent when the assembly was utterly incapable of electing a successor to the president when his time ended in 1980
2. Economic crisis.

## Foreign dynamics during that time between 60 and 80

Although maintaining national security and territorial integrity remains Turkey's foremost foreign policy, there were several shifts that Ankara pursued to achieve this goal. 

* Successive govts focused in increasing turkey's strategic importance for the West (US + EU) so that Turkey would be able to get financial, economic and military aid from these countries and establish friendly relationships.

* Turkey entered the 60s withs its close US relations:

    These two countries signed 56 agreements which allowed US their right to build and operate military installations/bases in Turkey. These bases however later on became problematic, because many Turks resented the financial burden on their govt imposed by the responsiblity of these bases (for example protection, storage and care of the weapons, the maintenance of the environmental security and so on...). Some of the turks were critical about the rights and priviledges given to these American personel working in Turkey (judicial privileges, postal service, tax-free shopping...) because of the liberties, they were openly critical about these grants given to the US personel. Govt was trying not to spend too much attentions to this criticism yet they had to reconsider its policy towards the US administration because of the politcal events that occured:

    1. **Cuban missile crisis of 62-63:** When US president John F. Kennedy yielded to soviet demands that the US missiles based in Turkey be withdrawn in exchange for the S.U not installing missiles in Cubans. This gave a feeling that Turkey was nothing but a pawn in the hands of US. Feeling that US was willing to forgo its assurances when US interests were at stake. It was kind of unexpected/a shock. Aftermath: An intensification of Turkey's relations with the soviets and with the European community (no EU at that time). Concentrated on fostering relations with the soviets. As for EU, Turkey had joined the EU as an associate member in 64 and increased considerably the trade with its countries. Turkey became the most important trading partner of EU. Furthermore, the economic growth that Europe was witnessing created a demand for Turkish labor and thousands of Turkish workers moved to European countries (mainly Germany, France, Austria.) This reduced unemployment in Turkey and increased foreign exchange, easing the impact of Turkish debt..

    2. **Cyprus crisis with the US (the 63-64 one)**: The growing tension between Greek/Turkish Cypriots led to Turkey to intervene but was prevented by US. Then came the 74 crisis which damaged the relations with the US even more.

    3. **Opium crisis (Hashhash)**

    4. **Cyprus crisis 74**

    By 1978, SU was aiding 44 different development projects in Turkey and, by the end of the decade, Turkey received more Soviet economic assistance than any other country in the 3rd world except Cuba. In that period, Turkey sort of turned to the Arab world and worked to heal its relations with the Arab world, (One of the first countries that recognized Israel was Turkey) but there was no significant development in these relations. Arabs regarded Turkey as a traitor (for the recognition)

# Lecture 6 (Zoom), April 21th, 2020

* 21st National Security Council in 10 days' time announced a retired admiral (Bulent Ulusu) as the Prime Minister and he would be the head of 27-member cabinet appointed by them.
* There would be a consultative assembly, but its powers would be limited because final decision making power rested in the hands of the NSC. 
* The president Kenan Evren said that all the problems originated because of the previous politicians, so they should be out of the political arena, banned and not part of this political process anymore.
* Definitely established a monopoly of power in Turkish politcal scene. Forces all over the country began a campaign of arrests, mostly left-wing supporters, communist organization etc were closed down.
* Interestingly, before 1980 coup, every single day on both sides used to be killed. This political violence was on the increase. Right after this coup, the very next day, this political violence immediately stopped, in a day!

**Who are these people that were arrested?**

1. Politicians
2. Trade unionists
3. University professors/lecturers
4. Teachers
5. Lawyers
6. Leading journalists
7. Anyone and everyone who expressed even slightly sympathetic towards left or towards right! but they treated the left more severely.

Some institution that came form the institution (like the senate) were removed Setup a new institution by this new 1982 constitution: Higher Education Counsil (Yüksek Öğretim Kurulu). It was founded in order to establish centralized authority over the universities. NSC also wanted to form a mechanism to control religion in society but was **more tolerant** towards Islam than had been expected.

**How come that an institituion that is supposed to protect the founding principles of a secular society, is tolerant towards Islam?**

* Religion, in a controlled form, could be used against communism
* Someone told them "If you want to fight communism then you need to foster Islam" because Islam was the antidote of communism.

* The religious classes were coupled with literacy ones, with the belief that it opens the door to the knowledge and skills that helps individuals to integrate in society (and reduce the feeling of inferiority?)

**Who was going to adopt this policy and further it in Turkey and absolutely stick to this _religious_ policy?**
- 

* It could not hold power indefinitely, in the face of increasing demands for elections. 
* After west German foreign minister visited Ankara in 1980, the authoritarian regime of the govt. could lead to Turkey's expulsion from council of Europe. Turkey was being threatened by losing its membership and
* Consitution was prepared in 1982 and was submitted to a referandum November 7th 1982. 92% because they wanted to go back to civilian regime immediately and army should go back to its barracks and execise its constitutional duty which is to protect the country from domestic and foreign intrusion. While people were voting for it, most were unaware that they were voting for the presidency of Kenan Evren.

They believe that 1962 had so much freedom that these freedom were exploited by the people. It was too much in other words. Therefore they attempted to reverse some of its provisions.

## The new consitution:

* Increased the power of the president
* Gave the right to the president to dissolve the parliament and call a general election if parliament was paralyzed
* Could declare the national emergency
* Could select members of the constitutional court (Anayasa Mahkemesi) from nominations provided by the court and consuls.
* 1982 constitution replaced the former by unicameral legislation.
* Speaking Kurdish in public was forbidden
* Like all previous constitutions, sovereignty was in the hands of people and all citizens were equal before the law, without care of race/gender/political beliefs etc.
* Freedoms and rights could be suspended/limited in the event of war. Marshal law could be easily declared in bad times.
* Freedom of press was limited.
* Freedom of trade unions was limited

They did not want this democracy to bring power once again to the politicians who had dominated the politcal arenas in 1970s.   

On April 4th 1983, Consultative Assembly announced the Law on Political Parties which imposed certain restrictions on the formation of political parties. They were trying to disqualify the old political leaders. They wanted to keep them out of the political arena. 

They encouraged the creation of new political parties and new political leaders. They brought a new rule/law on the election of deputies which stipulates that:

> Political parties that did not get at least 10% of the votes in the general or partial elections **could not have any** deputies in the assembly

**If there is such a stipulation in your own country's constitution, what would be the impact?**

# Lecture 7 (Zoom), April 28th, 2020

There were 15 new parties formed but only 3 of these satisfied the conditions to compete in November 1983 elections. 

**Who were they?**
NSC decided that only 3 out 15 new parties could run for the general elections in November 1983. The parties were

1. Party of Nationalist Democracy (Milliyetci Demokrasi Partisi): The military establishment clearly stood for this party. 
2. Populist Party (Halkci Parti):
3. Motherland Party (Anavatan Partisi): The leader of this party was Turgut Özal. Probably only truly civilian candidate among other parties. 

MP won a landslide victory with over 45% of the vote in the elections. **Why?**

1. Only truly civilian candidate, not supported by the miltiary
2. Projected a liberal, anti-stateist, anti-bureaucratic image 
3. Promised a quick return to civilian rule

Elections were not completely free and fair. The other parties were not allowed to run for the elections. They got vetoed by the NSC. Those parties were

1. Social Democratic Party (Sosysal Demokrasi Partisi): led by Pr. Eldal Inonu of Physics in Bogazici, son of Inonu.
2. True Path Party (Dogru Yol Partisi): led by Suleyman Demirel. Setup this new party

Turgut Ozal became Prime Minister and dominated the political arena for the next decade.

**Who supported Ozal?**
His party was supported by a rather diverse group of interests - many of which had joined MP because they had no other viable alternative. Ozal was able to skillfully bring together these diverse groups of interests. 

1. Business people: who favored economic liberalism
2. Islamists

    He was known to be a religous person, or to be more precise, know to have closer links to religious institutions/groups/sects/communities. His brother especially had a very close relation to those. That is why islamist voted for him

3. Nationalist right-wing groups

As soon as he won, he claimed that his "party would work to benefit all the turks who had largely been ignored by the 'elitist' parties of the past". The lower and middle classes, he termed, the central pillar of society (orta direk), promising that Turkey would soon prosper and would benefit the lower and middle classes. That is how he enlisted the support of these large groups. 
The Motherland Party benefited form the fact that there is no real alternative to it in the country. These former politicians were banned from engaging in political activities. That's how this party felt free, really. Suleyman Demirel, Bulten Ecevit, Erbakan (leader of islamist Wellfare Party) and the other ones (like Nationalist Labor Party) were banned...

His main challenge would come later on from Suleyman Demirel because as the more liberal and the more democratic members of the center-right groups started congregating around Demirel's party. Ozal became increasingly Islamist in order to expand its support base since many of its members were escaping.

In 1987, Ozal came under a lot of pressure to restore the political rights of the old politicians. Ozal could have done it through a parliament, that would have been much easier. Instead of taking that route, he made a __referandum__. He knows that the parliament would agree immediately but there is a chance that the public wouldn't. Because the public suffered under those old politicians. He didn't want them to accept so that he keeps his power.

People said these bans should be lifted: September 6th 1987 by 50.2%
=> Demirel became the true leader of Motherland Party (wtf?), Necmettin Erbakan became the leader of the islamist party

## Political areana

Was dominated by q: **who would succeed Kenan when his trial expired?**

His term ended in 1989, so the question was: **Who would succeed President General Kenan Evren?**

* Ozal replaced him but that was against the will of general public. **Why against?**

    Ozal's popularity was declining as a result of his economic policies. They failed to bring prosperity to the public, especially to the ones he called "Orta Direk". The poor people became poorer and the rich people became richer. His economic policies, 24th of January decisions (24 Ocak karlari). These economic decisions were taken in January 1980, well before the 1980 coup. These decisions were too harsh on ordinary people, and could only be implemented in extraordinary circumstances. It would be most likely that there would be uprisings and protests.

    Because of the high inflation, the living standards of people declined, his govt. was unable to curb the inflation and he was unable to improve the economy. The majority of the people did not benefit from this economic package. **That's why 1980 coup came to help implement these decisions**

    People were thinking that he should not be the next president. He nevertheless believed that this would be his only chance to keep the office, because he knew and everybody knew that, he would not be in the office in the next general elections. The only way is for him to become a president.

    The opposition was outraged and boycotted the sessions of the assembly in which the Ozal was elected.
    
    The Motherland Party's majority ensured that Ozal became the 8th president of the Turkish Republic.

    Economic decisions had led significant problems during the 1980s:

    1. The country saw some significant economic growth, for sure. But it also endured an extremely high inflation rate. The wages were increased but the wages were always behind the inflation rate.

    The high inflation rate worsened the situation and living stds. for middle and lower classes.

    The situation is like this: You gradually became poorer. You have nothing to lose. You have no hope. You can barely survive. In the meantime, you started migrating a rural area to the big cities. In these big cities, you have no jobs because you dont have proper education. Not much income, living in shantytowns, have a family to look after... **What would you do?** Two options:

    1. Go out and shout and protest 
    2. You turn to religion because that was the only thing that you had that you can cling to. You become more and more religious because that was the only hope. There were religous institutions that were there to help you... (Cemaat)

    
    There were there these institutions who gave hope and clinged to Islam. That's why the religiosity in this country increased. Obviously the govt. policies promoted that.

    People turned to Islam more an more as the solution to their problems. Interestingly, even the military started to recognize Islam as an essential element holding together the fragmented and polarized society.

# Lecture 8 (Zoom), May 4th, 2020

By 1980, the hostilities between these two leaders/countries have reemerged at the forefront of international politics because the concerns of American security reached a peak after two significant events that took place in the Middle East:

* Iranian Islamic revolution (1979) there was a change of regime in Iran.
* USSR invaded Afghanistan. It was another blow to the U. S. as it lost another partner in the region.

Because of these two events, the US-USSR relations were rather shaky. Therefore, US heartily supported 1980 military coup in Turkey. US couldn't afford to lose another ally to the Soviet Union. Even before the coup, Turkey and US already, on March 29th 1980, reached enough compromises to conclude "US-TR Defense and International Cooperation Agreement" (DICA). These negotiations on both sides had been hagging for over 5 years and finally both sides reached an agreement.

The signs of emerging good US-TUR relations:

* That was the first sign of good relations on the part of the US and Turkey.
* The second sign was a Memorandum of Understanding: concerning the modernization of a dozen of airfields in the eastern part of Turkey.
* The third sign was that Washington, by 1981, steadily increased the total amount of foreign assistance/aid extended to Turkey. This increased shortly after 1980 coup (4 times higher than it used to be).
* Decided to take the support to Turkish military system one step further and decide to modernize the troubled air defenses. They decided to help Turkey's air defense industry program.

Politically, militarily, financially they stood by Turkey after the coup.

One reason for this intensification of this US-TUR alliance was policy changes in the US. 

* The American defense budget increased significantly in those years. In fact, it was coupled with hostile rhetoric towards the USSR.
* President Ronald Regan advocated taking a strong stance against possible USSR encroachment by bolstering American power. Soviets were the 1. enemy of the US.

As we mentionned earlier, the military junta behind the coup promoted strong pro-American and pro-NATO policies. This wasn't really onesided. The Americans were very happy that the coup brought stability to a country in chaos. Otherwise, Turkey could have been lost to the communism. A stable Turkey in a region of instability was in the best interest of American policy makers because of the Arab issue, because of what happened in Afghanistan... because it meant it would be a strategic stable ally.

Despite this renewed sense of cooperation between US and TR, there were still some issues that led to a considerable conflict between the two countries:

1. The Americans were dissatisfied with the fact that Turkey was **unwilling to give unlimited access** to bases in Turkey to American troops stationed in the Persian gulf and in the Middle East

2. Turkish cypriots had declared an independent Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) shortly before the free general elections (which brought Ozal to power). They were dissatisfied that Ankara recognized this state immediately. The other two countries that recognized it shortly after it was declared: Pakistan and Bagladesh (they quickly changed their mind though, saying they made a mistake).

    

Meanwhile, the Turks were never fully content with the American economic aid amount, always critical of the amount. They were comparing with the aid given to the Greeks.
Turks also resented US-(Armenian/Greek) lobbies that campaigned against Turkey in congress.

## Other actors in the International System

### Russian relations

The mid-to-late 1980s saw significant changes in the structure of the international system.

In March 1895, Gorbachev assumed power with such goals of 

* reforming domestic political processes
* developing better relations with US
* improve Soviet economy

He took a different attitude toward the West, and he was (in his own words) "confident that the US would not deliberately attack the Soviet Union". With the belief that the Soviet Union would be able to fix its problems only with peaceful relations with the world, it took a policy of accomodation rather than confrontation. We witnessed a Geneva summit. 

They talked about:

* The arms reduction proposal.
* Loosening of trade restrictions
* Exchange of spies and political prisoners

They immediately signed the INF (Intermediate Range Nuclear Force) treaty in 1987. It called for **the total elimination of medium and short-range weapons within 3 years**. In other words, nuclear arm races between these two blocks was coming to an end. Soviet military troops withdrew from Afghnistant as a sign of good will shortly after the signature of INF treaty.

As a result of this "new thinking" in the soviet part, Turkish-Soviet relations improved. There were several official visits exchanged between the two countries' Chief of Staff. In 1988, Turkish officers were invited to watch Soviet military maneuvers. Two countries decided that they were going to accelerate the steps they are going to take in order to improve economic relations. They also wanted to cooperate in the economic relations.

Obstacles remained however. Turkey and USSR disagreed over a number of critical issues:

1. Moscow supported greek claims that turkish troops had to be withdrawn from Cypriots. USSR took the side of greek cypriots. 
2. Fishing rights in the Black Sea which the two countries shared.
3. Soviet tolerance of repression of Turkish minority in Bulgaria. ("Not turkish but bulgarian muslims") Started turning Turkish names by force to Bulgarian names for example.

### European relations

There isn't much to say here. The relations with European allies remained kind of problematic/strained.
Europeans were harshly critical about human rights issues in Turkey. Because of these bad/negative records, Europeans claimed that Turkish refugees who asked and received for political asylum became a burden on European economies. That's why they held Turkey responsible. 

Turkey on the other hand was very willing of the European committee at the time and was doing its best of becoming a member, passing a lot of laws through its parliament. Because it was successfuly implementing these rules it applied for membership in April 1987 with the hope that they'd see the effort that Turkey made.

The economic restructuring and growth that it had undergone led politicians to believe that they had a good chance of joining the EU. However the Europeans rejected Turkey's application for membership, saying that Turkey had relatively backward and unstable economy and they still had territorial/politics disputes etc.

### Middle-East relations

Remained strained, if not openly hostile between 1980-1990. Because it valued its own territorial integrity and national security, Turkey tried to stay out of the turbulent conflicts of the ME. For example:

* It maintained a strict neutrality in the Iran-Irak war 1980-1988 and secured friendly relations with both countries. In those years, these countries were Turkey's most important export market, especially Iran. Irak was pumping oil to the Turkish pipeline.
* Relations with Irak and Syria deteriorated due to disagreements over the flow of water through the Euphyrites and Tigress (???) rivers. These downstream countries were concerned about the flow diminishing as a result of the building of the huge dam on the Euphryites (Ataturk Dam). In order to guarantee the flow, they started giving even more support to PKK terorrists.
* Relations with Greece also remained difficult. There was a number of attempts by the UN to start negotations between the Turkish and Greek side over the Cypress issue. That was unfortunately unsuccessful. The two countries continued to clash over such as issues as oil rights on the continental shelf, rights to airspace, and the Aegean islands issue. Greek authorities are sending troops to the Greek islands, while according to the still valid Lausane treaty the islands should be demilitarized.
* Turkey experienced a crisis with Bulgaria (1989). Bulgarian govt accelerated its policies of forced assimilation of Turksh minority. The situation was very tense, and created a wave of nationalist feeling in Turkey. It wasn't ready for this influx of people, yet the PM made a statement "here we are happy to welcome you" while there are no jobs, no place to host them... This crisis was dissipiated when most of these refugees gradually returned to Bulgaria.

# Lecture 9 (Zoom), May 12th, 2020

Ozal's popularity was on the decline toward the end of 1980s. The govt. had to face so many challenges:

1. Increase in inflation and couldn't really curb it.
2. Slow economic growth
3. Relations with the EU were somehow troublesome. Despite Turkey's eagerness and effortness to be part of it, they weren't really sympathetic.
4. PKK's terror activity in south east part of Turkey gained momentum. It was a serious drain on economic resources.
5. In the background, increasing role of Islam in society and politics that Ozal followed towards these islamist groups. He made a lot of concessions towards these Islamic sects/institutions/cemaat by expanding the role of education, the number of mosques... That sort of created uneasiness in some circles. 

## Economic decisions of the 1980

The liberal economic policies of the 1980s followed by the govt. have greatly increased the differences between the rich and poor. They didn't take any precautions and Turkey didn't have any ability to cope with the western economies.

* On the one hand, an entirely new class, often very wealthy, has risen. These were close to the MP or close to the politicians and received financial help from the govt. 

Fortunes were made in import/export, construction and banking.

* On the other hand, purchasing power for the majority of the people drastically declined.

Govt tightened its economic policies in order to contain public sector deficit and in order to curb the inflation. In response to strong social and political pressures for wage increase, monetary and fiscal policies were relaxed. Therefore, in 1990, there was economic growth to a certain degree. It reached to a 9% or something for a short period of time. But this was sharply cut back in 1991 because of the Gulf War. This disrupted trade with Irak, including blocking Irak's oil outlet via Turkey. Turkey lost an awful lot of money because of this war.

> Ozal believed (or was made believed) he would make benefit out of the war if he joined on the side of US.

These economic austerity programs led to a serious economic crisis in the years to come. One after the other, Turkey suffered serious economic crises. 

* Huge devaluation of TL

In order to help stabilize the situation, Turkey was at the door step of IMF, and IMF obviously provided a standby loan to Turkey, given they follow some instructions. In this IMF program, the major problem for Turkish economy as a) management, b) curtailment of public sector expenditure. There were various public sector drains. __What were these drains?__  

1. __State economic enterprises__ (Kamu Iktisadi Tesebbusleri(?)): Smth had to be done about these. The solution advised by IMF was to privatize them and get rid of them.
2. __Inadequately financed social security system__
3. __Agricultural credits given by the govt to the farmers/villagers__
4. __Large public bureaucracies__ with opportunity for early retirement. (More than 30 years they receive pension!)

5. __Inadequacy of the direct taxation system__: the total tax revenue was very low compared to the developed countries.

A major result of large public expenditure and insufficient taxation has been substantial public deficit. Their financing by the govt was seen to be the chief factor of inflation.

In 1998 the inflation rate was 80% (?). Of course the inflation had disruptive effect on

1. Savings
1. Investment
1. Long term planning
1. Trust in the Turkish currency

__What were the measures taken by the govt?__  

* Privatization was seen as the main/prime solution to this difficulty.
* Raising the retirement age to reduce pension
* Increase the efficiency of the tax collection including widening its scope to cover the unnofficial economy.

## Foreign policy between 1990s to 2000s (Post Cold War period)
At the begininng of this new era, many turkish leaders proclaimed that Turkey's foreign policy goals remained unchanged in the face of tremendous alterations in the international system.

There were some considerable foreign policy shifts immediately after the breakdown of the Soviet Union:

1. Turkey usually avoided involvment in the policy of the MidEast. Ozal tried to use the Gulf war to make Turkey one of the first countries to ally with the US against Irak in August 1990. In fact, Turkey became the first nation in the region to denounce the invasion of Kuweit and first to support UN sanctions and the first to make the blockade by shutting down Irak's pipeline. This was totally contradictory to Turkey's historical position since the declaration of the republic. In addition to that, nearly 100,000 Turkish troops were mobilized on the Turkish-Iraqi border. On top of it, Turkey allowed the Americans to use major military installations to bomb. By giving Turkey such a crucial ..., Ozal clearly wanted to demonstrate Turkey's allegiance to its Western allies, just like Adnan Menderes did by sending Turkish troops to join the Korean war, afterwhich Turkey was able to join NATO. Ozal argued that Turkey's role in the allied coalition against Irak would not only carve out an important role to Turkey but elevate its status as "a strong stronghold in the Middle East". In return, the US increased the security assistance and extended additional trade benefits to Turkey.

2. They shared the same views on the need to defend Bosnia-Herzegovina. Although neither country was willing to take unilateral action in the region, they both called on the international community to help the Bosnian Muslims. Nobody helped but Turkey and US did.

3. The US applauded Turkey's effort to find new avenues of cooperation with Russia and supported the formation of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Project (BSECP). (to create favorable conditions and establish institutional arrangments among the BS countries). __Why did US support this?__ It was hoping that through this agreement, Turkey would be able to affect the economic dev. of former Soviet Union state in such a way as to foster democratic and _capitalist_ economies in the newly independent former Soviet Union states.

4. US counted on Turkey to stand up against "evil" regimes in the country like Iran, Irak, Syria to support "moderate" regimes

5. Help consolidate the coming Israeli peace. One of the first countries that recognized Israel was Turkey in 1948.

6. Turkey also allowed US to make use of military airbases in carrying out of relief operations for the autonomous Kurdish provinces in the Northern Irak.
