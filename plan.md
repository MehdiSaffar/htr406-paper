    - DP govt, Celal Bayar president and Adnan Menders PM 

        > Turkey under the Democrats, 1950–60 In the DP government Celâl Bayar
        > became president and Adnan Menderes prime minister, a post which for
        > the first time came to surpass that of the president in importance.

    - DP commited to economic growth by reducing state interference (more liberalist policy) 

        > The Democrats were committed to a program of economic growth, to be
        > achieved through a reduction of state interference.

    - At first they had a good time

    > At first they had much success, assisted by good harvests in 1950 and 1953
    > and by an economic boom caused by the Korean War (1950–53).
    [^3]: [@br].

    - Poor harvest obliged Turkey to import wheat (britannica)

        > But problems appeared after 1953. In 1954 another poor harvest
        > obliged Turkey to import wheat again. A shortage of foreign exchange
        > limited the purchase of essential materials and parts, which
        > handicapped industry.

    - High inflation of 15% 

        > Inflation, which averaged 15 percent or more annually, became a
        > serious problem. The government attempted unsuccessfully to control
        > prices through legislation, but its continually rising public
        > expenditure worsened inflation. Despite the problems, the DP
        > achieved considerable political success throughout the 1950s.

    - CHP accused DP of reversing principles of secularism

        > The CHP strenuously accused the DP of reversing the principles of
        > secularism and favouring conservative religious organizations.
        > Indeed, the DP had relaxed some of the secularist policies of pure
        > Kemalism, following in the steps of the CHP in the years 1945–49.
        > Religious instruction in schools had been extended and the
        > organization of religious schools permitted. Arabic had been
        > reinstated for the call to prayer, and radio readings of the Qurʾān
        > had been allowed.

    - DP is intolerant towards oppposition

        > One of the most concrete indications of the DP’s intolerance and
        > attempt to immobilize the opposition was the law about confiscation
        > of the RPP’s property and devolvement of the property to the
        > treasury.  On December 9, 1953, the National Assembly voted to
        > confiscate the majority of Republican Party’s property. 
        (book2)
        [^7]: [@bb].

    - Democrats felt insecure and inferior to Ismet, felt lack of control over the state

        > The Democrats felt insecure as long as Ismet Inonu was leader of the RPP. Inonu
        > also brought out a sense of inferiority in a way the Democrats could not explain. The real
        > reason behind this insecurity was that, although the Democrats held the political power,
        > they were uncertain about their hold over the state (the armed forces, bureaucracy,
        > universities, judiciary, and press). All these institutions primarily remained loyal to Inonu
        > and the RPP. Therefore, the DPP emphasized its dependence on the national will (milli
        > irade)
        (book2)
        [^8]: [@bb].

        > The Democrats many times attempted to use the military forces to stop Inonu
        > from entering cities or towns, and prevent him from addressing the citizens.
        > However, these attempts always backfired. Due to their respect for the old
        > commander, officers and soldiers put their weapons down and did not stand on
        > his way

    - Mounting criticism within and outside of DP, but responded with repression

        > Subsequent economic difficulties led to mounting criticism within and
        > outside the DP, to which the government responded with increasing
        > repression.
        ...
        > Opposition attacks upon the DP became stronger, and it was accused of
        > unconstitutional action. At the same time, the Democrats, fearing a

    - DP did not stick to its programme of improving the situation of the miilitary. Many soldiers struggled to survive 

        > During this period, the administration, with the Milli Sef ... and his accomplices inthe lead, adopted
        > a patronising and belittling attitude towards thearmy and the officers and
        > the generals who led it. The cost of livingand the struggle to survive was
        > humiliating and suffocating to theofficers.  Everywhere  they  were
        > treated  like  second  class  humanbeings. In Ankara, people had labelled
        > basement flats ‘Staff-Officerflats’.  In  places  of  entertainment
        > officers  were  nicknamed‘lemonaders’  because  they  could  not  afford
        > to  order  expensivedrinks and compete with the black-marketeers and
        > profiteers; thesons of this sacrificing nation were described by such names
        ...
        > After  the  war  people  like  Türkes  hoped  that  multi-party  politicsand
        > the  Democrat  victory  would  improve  the  situation  for  thecountry  and
        > the  army.  The  reform  of  the  armed  forces  was  longoverdue and was part
        > of the DP’s programme.

        > The situation which the officers were in during the 1950s was a
        > result of general materialist trends promoted by the DP policies.
        > Downgraded by government policies, the military personnel’s morale

    - Menderes did not care about military reform

        > Menderes’s  attitude  to  military  reform,  if  that  involved
        > spendingprecious  money,  was  the  same  as  his  attitude  towards

        > stopped by government officials, and he was asked to return to Ankara. After
        > a three-hour delay, he was permitted to go. Even so, the government started
        > to accuse the opposition of instigating the military for a military coup, and

3. Coup
    - Turkes had a different agenda than most people
        > The solutions that were acceptable to them after  they  seized  power
        > were  also  borrowed  from  the  intelligentsiawhich  supported  the
        > opposition.  Only  a  few  officers  with  a  radicalbent, men like
        > Türkes and Erkanli, had an agenda for taking Turkey in  a  direction
        > different  from  the  one  envisaged  by  the  elites.  These people
        > may well have been influenced by what they were witnessing
        > inneighbouring countries like Nasser’s Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and
        > Pakistan, all under military rule in 1960.

    - Coup declared on May 27, 1960 on Ankara radio

        > On the morning of May 27, 1960, the intervention was declared to
        > Turkish citizens by the 7 a.m. broadcast over Ankara Radio:

        > Honorable fellow countrymen! Owing to the crisis into which our democracy
        > has fallen, in view of the recent sad incidents, and in order to avert
        > fratricide, the Turkish Armed Forces have taken over the administration
        > of the country. Our armed forces have taken this initiative for the

        > which they have fallen … (and will hold) just and free elections as soon
        > as possible under the supervision and arbitration of an above-party
        > administration.
        (book2)
        [^15]: [@bb].


    - Coup lasted only 18 months, NUC returned to civilian life

        > The military rule after the 1960 coup d’état lasted only eighteen
        > months, and the NUC kept its promise to return the country to a
        > democratic administration as quickly as possible. The main reason for
        > this was Ataturk’s efforts and emphasis (during his life) on keeping
        > the military and politics separate. 
        (book2)

    - Roadmap not clear, either give back to Ismet, or new elections, or make new constitution first

        > Over the first days of the coup, the road map that the junta would
        > follow was not clearly determined. While some these officers intended
        > to hand over the government to Ismet Inonu, some of them believed
        > that the government should be chosen by free elections after
        > eliminating politicians who had been involved in bribery and
        > corruption.  Meanwhile a third group among these officers was not in
        > favor of handing over the government to civilians until
        > constitutional changes were made. Since the highest ranking officers
        > were in the third group, the junta agreed on the need for
        > constitutional changes first.25
